\section{Summary}
The report first provides a high level overview of practices for survival and design response analysis of WECs.
A general workflow for this process, subprocesses, including design case specification, environmental characterization, modeling, experimental testing, fatigue and extreme response statistics, were examined.
Finally, a more detailed review on the current state of art of existing appraches on DLC analysis were presented.
Currently, the ECM team is working on a case study to demonstrate a systematic framework for establishing the design loads of a WEC. The proposed design load methodology incorporates existing design guidelines, where they exist, and follows a typical design progression; namely, advancing from many, low-fidelity, conceptual stage design computations to a few, computationally intensive, high-fidelity, design validation simulations. The preliminary results from the study were presented in \cite{VanRij2018}. The goal of this on going study is to and document and verify this process based on quantitative evaluations of the design loads' accuracy at each design step and consideration for the computational efficiency of the entire design process. The final outcome from the study will be included in the final best-practices document for the prediction of design responses and loads for WECs, which in expected to be completed by Q4 FY18.
