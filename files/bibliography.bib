  abstract  = {Survivability is by no means a new concept to ocean engineering; ships must remain stable and structurally intact in violent sea states; the same is true for offshore oil and gas structures.
 While knowledge from the ship and offshore sectors can be valuable for designing wave energy converters ({WECs}) for survival in rough seas, the unique scale, siting and operational characteristics of {WECs} pose a distinct set of engineering challenges.
 This paper seeks to provide a review of methods for modeling the loading and dynamic response of {WECs} and analogue marine structures, such as ships and offshore structures, in large nonlinear waves.
 We identify current knowledge gaps in our understanding of {WEC} survivability and provide recommendations for future research to close these gaps.},
